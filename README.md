## Process

Since the first project idea presentation I've iterated on my idea in response to the feedback I got.

Instead of two stereotypical-looking anthropomorphic robots, I've pivoted to a network of three robots resembling plants or muchrooms. I plan to use natural materials, such as rocks, sticks, and leaves, and maybe even some plants in the installation as decoration. The robots will make noise via antennas and amplifiers, but will move by opening and closing like umbrellas. When they are being viewed they will close and stop moving and stop making noise. I plan to use the antenna signals to determine the rate of opening and closing, as sort of a feedback loop. In class I will demonstrate a working prototype of one of these robots opening and closing via a stepper motor.

I will be uwing bi-polar, four-wire stepper motors. 

I will be using the L293D chip as a driver between the motor and Arduino.

I think I will have a separate Arduino for each motor. 

I have so far followed this tutorial's code and schematic: https://lastminuteengineers.com/stepper-motor-l293d-arduino-tutorial/
